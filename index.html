    <title>Development of a Nobel model to find EV  charging stations in close Proximity</title>
    <meta name="description" content="As Electric Vehicles (EV) become more popular, the demand for compatible, available charging infrastructure has grown. EV owners face the availability of charging slots, the long waiting periods, and difficulties finding a suitable charging station; ease-of-use, convenience, and optimally utilizing an EV charging station's resources, should all be the focus. This project proposes an innovative web-based solution for finding and reserving EV charging stations in advance. It allows users to enter their location (ZIP code) and find charging stations nearby, confirm the availability of slots, select a date, select a time slot, and make a reservation based on their desired connector type (CCS, CHAdeMO, Type 2). By reserving in advance, users can minimize their charging waiting times, reduce traffic congestion at the charging stations, and enhance the overall user experience. We want to provide users with a simple platform that will enhance the user experience of EV charging stations, more effectively make use of resources at each EV charging station, and assist with EV adoption. By addressing real-world problems associated with EV charging, this project will further the development of a greener and smarter mobility ecosystem.">
